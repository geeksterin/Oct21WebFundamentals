1. Why Style is written in head and scripts are written at last.
-> Improvement in UI, the style is already available when the HTML is loaded.
-> Tradeoff of performance, we are not loading unnecessary functionality before.


2. Types of list:
    -> ul
    -> ol
    -> dl
        -> dl
        -> dt

3. What is an eventListener?
    -> Callback function which is executed when an event happens.

i++ -> i = i + 1;
i-- -> i = i - 1;


getElementById
getElementsByTagName
getElementsByName
querySelector
querySelectorAll

-> Variables inside a string.

<!-- let n = 10;
console.log("something " + n + " else");
console.log(`something ${n} else`); -->
